# Image-Segmentation-ML
A project on image segmentation using machine learning
Overview
This repository contains a basic implementation of image segmentation using OpenCV in Python. The primary goal of this project is to differentiate and categorize objects within an image.

Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
How to Run
Ensure you have Python and OpenCV installed.
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Image-Segmentation-ML.git
Navigate to the directory:
cd Image-Segmentation-ML
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
Copy code
jupyter notebook image_segmentation.ipynb
Replace 'path_to_your_image.jpg' in the code with the path to an image on your system.
Execute the notebook to see the segmented image.
Results
The code processes the input image, converts it to grayscale, detects edges using the Canny detector, and then finds and draws contours to segment the objects in the image.
